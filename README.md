# amazon-mws-feed
Python program to submit an xml feed to Amazon through the MWS API.

I thought this would be useful to anyone using the Amazon MWS API. This is most useful for uploading XML files
for products on Amazon. 

In order to run, you must have boto installed, and it must be version 2. To do so, run $ pip install boto from
your command line. 

This will return a Feed Submission ID, which you can use to retrieve the feed submission result.
